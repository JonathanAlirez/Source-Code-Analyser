# Source-Code-Analyser
A Java GUI to show the difference between two similar source code files.

#Uses
This Java GUI shows the differences between two different files. This can be source code or really anything.
This program excels at showing the differences by highlighting different lines between the two files.
This is an excellent program if you need to see the subtle differences between your code and someone elses,
maybe there was just a semi colon missing, this program will highlight the line that is missing the semi colon so
you can go fix it.

#Issues
Currently, both files have to be the same length, that being the same ammount of lines. This will hopefully be addressed in
the future, but as of currently it isn't.
